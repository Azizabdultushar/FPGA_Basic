Implemented a FSM <== inputs are gliders pitch angle(theta) from payload IMU.
  FSM ==> derives/output to glider state(Dive, climb, surface)
  when it will activate: state transition from dive to climb occurs.
    Once potential occurance of a seafloor approach is detected by FSM, the laser and the camera can be applied as 
      a range finder to validate the proximity to seafloor.
      if proximity to the seafloor is confirm the full imaging sequence used the cmaera with high power lighting.
