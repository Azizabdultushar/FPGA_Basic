# FPGA_Basic
## Bankrupt
- If you do mistakes in ASICs, then you company might be rankrupt.
- solution is: FPGA. found bug :) kein problem, rewrite the code or fix the bug, upload the code again.
- yahooooooo, its working again.
## CLB 
- consist of : LUT + multiplexor + Full adder+ D flipflop.
- I/O block > Block RAM > reconfigurable interconnect < I/O block
## advantages
- Performance
- reprogrammable
- cost: getting cheaper day by day.

## Application:
- aerospace: space engineering
- medical devices
- ASIC prototyping
- deep see robot
- Audio system
- wireless communication
- vedio system
- security or cryptography
